alight so this is the code for a simple rnn  in my project, and we use floatingpoint rep in this project fully, but since we aim to deploy this mode in an fpga using verilog (taking the weights from the trained model) we need to use fixed point rep. but floating point gives us a much better accuray in python. SO we want to rewrite this python code in a way that we are still using floating poiint rep but making it as if its fixed point rep like Q etc. and have variables/paramters taht we can change and specify the number of decimal cahrs and intergera part  size:
